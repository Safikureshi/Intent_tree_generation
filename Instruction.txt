Before run or execution of the program, The following instructions need to be done.

1. Required to install postgres EXTENSION pgvector for vector support

		Refer to the Link: https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector


2. After installation, two tables need to create in pgAdmin (Due to pgvector extension i have not crated the tables in program)
	
		CREATE TABLE intent_tree (treeid bigserial PRIMARY KEY, questions text[], tree jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb);
		CREATE TABLE intent_embeddings (nodeid bigserial PRIMARY KEY, treeid bigserial, embedding vector(1024));

Note: Might be some error can be displayed for the vector size(1024), due to maximum size 768. then padding will require 
				
		CREATE TABLE intent_embeddings (nodeid bigserial PRIMARY KEY, treeid bigserial, embedding vector(768));(Redefine)
		
		ALTER TABLE intent_embeddings ALTER COLUMN embedding SET DATA TYPE vector(768);
		UPDATE intent_embeddings
		SET embedding = pad_vector(embedding);


The program is in testing position. It will change. I also generated JSON file for looking of that tree.

About the program:

The program uses several libraries, including:

- numpy for numerical computations
- scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- transformers for the BERT language model
- torch for tensor computations
- json for JSON serialization
- nltk for natural language processing
- psycopg2 for PostgreSQL database interactions

The program also defines several functions, including:

- get_bert_embedding: generates a BERT embedding for a given question
- load_questions: loads a list of questions from a file
- create_initial_clusters: creates an initial set of clusters based on question embeddings
- merge_clusters: merges similar clusters together based on a similarity threshold
- build_hierarchy: builds a hierarchical intent tree by recursively merging clusters
- generate_intent_label: generates a label for a cluster based on its questions
- print_cluster_tree: prints a visual representation of the intent tree
- bfs_search: performs a breadth-first search to find similar clusters
- insert_question: inserts a new question into the intent tree
- store_intent_tree: stores the intent tree in a PostgreSQL database
- store_embeddings: stores the question embeddings in a PostgreSQL database
- construct_intent_tree: builds and stores the intent tree
